## Tutorial Setup

Prior to arriving at the event, clone this repository so that you will not have to download it at the venue. Also, make sure to run `composer install` after you have finished cloning. If you are able to do this, you are more likely to have a successful tutorial.

Keep in mind that there might be last minute changes to the repository. Check the night before the event to see if you need to pull any recent changes.

To be able to do the exercises in this tutorial, you need to have the following things set-up on your machine:

1. Composer
2. PHP 7.0 (or later)

It is expected that you know how to edit PHP files.

If you have questions related to any of the installation instructions below, please email me at beau@dflydev.com, or find me (simensen) on IRC's Freenode network channel #dflydev.

### Composer

Make sure you can call Composer through either just `composer`, or by calling `php /path/to/composer.phar`. I would recommend that you follow the instructions at https://getcomposer.org/download/ by running the 4 PHP commands, and then copy the installed `composer.phar` file to `/usr/local/bin/composer`:

    sudo cp composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

Now verify whether Composer works by running:

    composer --version

### PHP 7.0

Please install the PHP package through your package manager. For Debian and Ubuntu, this package is named `php`.

To verify whether your installation worked, run the following commands:

    php --version

Running this command should output something like this (pay attention to the version numbers):

    PHP 7.0.13-dev (cli) (built: Oct 30 2016 14:53:59) ( NTS DEBUG )
